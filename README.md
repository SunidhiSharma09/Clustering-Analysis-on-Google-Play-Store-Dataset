### CLUSTERING ANALYSIS ON GOOGLE PLAY STORE DATASET
#### Objective
This project focuses on performing a clustering analysis on the Google Play Store dataset to identify patterns and group similar applications together.The goal is to determine which clustering technique best fits the data set by comparing different algorithms and then analyze play store data using the particular technique
#### Introduction
Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning in machine learning where the goal is to group data points into distinct groups, or clusters, based on similarities in their features, 
to understand the underlying pattern and structure.
#### Clustering Techniques Performed and Compared
Before applying any clustering technique, we plotted some scatter plots(3D-scatter plot and Pair plot) to look at the shape of the data and get an idea of which technique would work better.
Then applied -
- K-Means Clusttering
- GMM Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN Clustering

NOTE - Comparison and analysis of dataset is provided in the pdf document.
